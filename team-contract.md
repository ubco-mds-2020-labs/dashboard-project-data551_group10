# Team Work Contract

## Goals

To help the Portuguese bank achieve higher revenues by 
designing a dashboard showing how data collected for last term deposit subscription campaign distributed 
and the predictions for what groups are the most likely to subscribe to the term deposit for this campaign.


## Meeting Norms

- Meeting by appointment via zoom
- We will meet at least twice a week, at least an hour each time outside of class and lab hours
- Group members will take turns to record any decisions made during group meetings.


## Work Norms

- About 15 hours per week that we anticipate it will take to make the project successful
- Other than what we need to contribute together, we would decide on each member's responsibilities first by personal preferences, and then try to divide tasks equally among group.
- We'll set group due date two days prior to the weekly deadlines, and take advantage of the last two days to have our work polished together via group meeting.
- If any member miss a group meeting for some reason, we would plan to have longer meeting time for the last two days.
- If any member does not follow through on a commitment, the rest of the group will cover his/her/their part of job and report on this situation later with instructors or TAs.
- Final work will be reviewed during the last two days of project deadlines via zoom meeting.
- If members have different opinions on the quality of the work, we would try to achieve the highest level under the given amount of time.
- We have our own group deadlines, so it is okay that members have different work habits.

## Decision Making

- We need 100% approval of all team members before making a decision
- If one of the member fixates on a particular idea and it cannot come to an agreement during the meeting, we'll finish all other work first and discuss about the idea later.
