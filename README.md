# Portuguese Banking Subscription Dashboard

Group Members: Mona Jia, Zhiyan Ma

## Dashboard Description

This dashboard is designed to help the Portuguese bank to achieve higher revenues by showing how data collected for last term deposit subscription campaign distributed and the predictions for what groups are the most likely to subscribe to the term deposit for this campaign, then to target our potential clients by groups (job type, marital status, age groups, etc.).

From the two (drop down) menus, users can filter out variables from the distribution display with functions such as sort, and view predictions for client subscription by age groups, education levels, etc. We also include a correlation heatmap to provide users with more insights of the data.
