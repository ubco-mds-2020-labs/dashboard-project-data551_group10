## Implementation and New Features

In milestone 2, we have re-wrangling the dataset into three new files. We have the raw bank data under the raw data folder, a reduced-size bank data. Since our 45,211 rows in our raw dataset, which is too large for the dashboard, we reduced the data to 5000 rows. We then process data to separate into categorical variables and numerical variables then put into bank_c and bank_n datasets. We also split the age group and puts it into the bank_g dataset. The bank_corr is organized to present the relationship between categorical variables and numerical variables.

Other than the heatmap plot we made in our latest report, we also made a plot for age group and a relationship map between numerical variables and categorical variables. To further understand the audience, we separate our prediction plots based on the current prediction result.

## Team Contribution

Our team had a high collaboration contribution. Mona contributes to the data wrangling and data analyzing part. Zhiyan responses to the plots relate to the prediction. The struggle we met was the first time using Heroku and failed to implement it for a long time.

## Limitation

We do not have a function likes machine learning which provides the most accurate prediction for our customer. If we have enough time, we will give that more precise prediction. We also lack multiple variables contribution analysis.

## Future Improvements

If it is possible, we want to have more investigation on users who have a financial background. Since the job and education level can affect our prediction a lot, we find out the financial experience might be the other essential factor.

We also want to improve our dashboard quality further. Due to the time limitation, we did not have time to analyze our data deeply. We want to have more time to consider our data and exploring more comprehensively.
