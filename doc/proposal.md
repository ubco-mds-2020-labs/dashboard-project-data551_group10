###### Portuguese banking institution "Subscription data app"

#### Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data scientist consultancy firm

Target audience: The Portuguese bank

Since the Portuguese bank needs more income during the covid-19 pandemic, we are trying to increase their subscribing of the term deposit. If we can narrow down the targeting customer and find the most influential subscribing factor, the bank can gain higher incomes. To solve the challenge, we will visualize the purchasing power of different categories of customers. Our data will also include the distribution of factors contributing to the subscribe/ no subscribe. Users can filter and re-order different variables to compare those factors.

#### Description of the data

We will visualize the dataset of approximately was 45,000 lines of data collected for clients related to direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution from May 2008 to November 2010. Each appointment has 16 predictors, clients' age (age), type of job (job), Marital Status (marital), an education level (education). has credit in default or not? (default), average yearly balance in Euros (balance), has housing loan or not? (housing), has a personal loan or not? (loan), contact communication type (contact), last contact day of the month (day) , last contact month of the year (month), last contact duration, in seconds (duration), number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (campaign), number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (pdays), number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (previous) and outcome of the previous marketing campaign (poutcome). Using this data will also predict has the client subscribed to a term deposit or not? (y)

#### Research questions and usage scenarios

Peter is a policymaker with the Portuguese bank. He wants to find out which factors affect the subscription of the term deposit the most to increase their annual incomes. Peter wants to be able to [explore] the client's data to [compare] the effect of different variables then [identify] the most relevant data to his policy. Peter logs on the "Subscription data app," he can see a board contains all variables in his dataset. Then he filters out the data based on the customer's age from the youngest to the oldest. He also compares other variables from head to head. He suddenly founds out the "campaign" is a strong predictor of the subscription. He hypothesis that customer who won the last campaign have more financial backgrounds. Since this factor is not recorded, he decides to follow up on research and include a financial background in his dataset.
