## Implementation and New Features
We have six plots. The first four of them are showing data analysis and data wrangling. The last two are showing how each variable is affecting the prediction. Our primary purpose is to help the bank visualize its data and narrow down the potential customers. Our app can fully achieve those functions. All functions on our plot are working and are with our expectations.

## Easy of Using Dashboard
Our app is easy to use because we separate each of our plots into one tab. We also include a brief instruction under each figure. Users can directly put their hands on the app and understand the app's meaning by reading those instructions. Users can also interact with the app to get further information. The only problem we met is that since our dataset is pretty large, even we pre-wrangled our data for each variable, the app's responding time is still pretty long. When changing from the first page to the second page, the website takes a long time to update. Since we still want to give our client a more comprehensive analysis, we will try to find a solution in our future implementation.

## Improved from Feedback
We were changed our line plot to bar plot and box plot to distribution plot during the last several feedback. Because based on the suggestions, those plots can illustrate our thoughts better. Thus, we adopt the suggestion and make corresponding changes. We also got several feedbacks saying our font size is pretty small. Then, we increase those letters in our latest dashboard.

## Problems We Had for Long-time
We still want to have a future implementation that includes a more intelligent predicting method, such as KNNs or Random Forest. This idea has been mentioned since the second model, but we still have not implemented it. If we have a longer construction time, we will achieve our goal and make a better prediction for our clients.
