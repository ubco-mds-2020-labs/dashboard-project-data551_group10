###### Portuguese banking institution "Subscription data app"

#### Motivation and Purpose

Our role: Data scientist consultancy firm

Target audience: The Portuguese bank

Since the Portuguese bank needs more incomes during the covid-19 pandemic, we are trying to help them increase their subscribing of the term deposit.If we can narrow down the targeting customer and find the most effective factor of subscribing, the bank can use those info to gain higher incomes. To solve
this challenge, we will make a visualization of the purchasing power of different categories of customers.
Our data will also includes the distribution of factors contributing to the subscribe/ no subscribe.
Users can filter and re-order different variables in order to compare those factors.

#### Research questions and usage scenarios

Peter is a policy maker with the Portuguese bank. He wants to find out which factors 
affect the subscription of the term deposite the most to increase their annual incomes.
Peter wants to be able to [explore] the clients data in order to [compare] the 
effect of different variables then [identify] the most relevant data to his policy. 
Peter logs on the "Subscription data app", he can see an board contains all variables
in his dataset. Then he filters out the data based on the age of the customer from the 
youngest to the oldest. He also compares other variables from head to head. He 
suddenly founds out the "campaign" is a strong predictor to the subscription. He
hypothesis that customer who won last campaign have more financial backgrounds. Since
this factor is not recorded, he decides to have a follow up research and include financial
backgroud in his dataset.
